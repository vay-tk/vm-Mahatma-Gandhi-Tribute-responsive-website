            <h2>About Mahatma Gandhi</h2>
            <p>Mahatma Gandhi, born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, was a prominent leader who advocated for non-violent civil disobedience in the struggle for Indian independence from British rule. His approach to social and political change inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.</p>
            <p>He played a crucial role in India's independence movement, leading various campaigns such as the Salt March in 1930, which was a direct action against British salt laws. His principles of non-violence (Ahimsa) and truth (Satyagraha) continue to resonate in social justice movements today.</p>
